Simple AWS lambda_handler to log activity (in this case from an Amazon IoT dash button) to Google Sheets

This is stripped down version of [Sam Machin's code to link up nexmo with Google Sheets](https://github.com/sammachin/LambdaSMSGoogle) and his [blog post](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2016/05/31/building-sms-google-sheets-application-aws-lambda/) with a couple other changes to support the payload from the button, and to convert times properly for my timezone.
